Battling the HIV epidemic: the role of mathematical and simulation models

Modern, effective anti-retroviral therapies can keep HIV-positive people healthy and prevent them from transmitting HIV. They may hold the key to rolling back the worldwide epidemic. Modeling efforts are a key part of making the case for aggressive intervention, and of making interventions efficient and effective. I will talk about modeling our lab's efforts to understand HIV spread, in the context of other modeling projects around the world.
